# Custom Android kernel manifest

This repository is just to setup a build environment for building custom Android kernels for devices I have.

Run the following command to get started: `repo init -u https://github.com/tangalbert919/kernel-build -b master`

Information on how to build Android kernels can be found [here](https://source.android.com/setup/build/building-kernels).
